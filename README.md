## Screenshots

## Dependencies

## TODO

- Conky
- Display current layout on the Polybar
- Rofi theme
- Find a better quality version of the background (or an alternative idk)
- Installation instructions (maybe)

*ps: I could not found the artist for the background, so if you find him, contact me !*
